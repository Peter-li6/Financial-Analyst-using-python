# Financial-Analyst-using-python
Welcome to my repository. In this repository I have uploaded code written in my 4th year Finance courses at the University of Toronto.
Themes include but are not limited to: 
1. Back-testing stock returns using Fama-French 3 Factor model and CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model)
2. Using Machine Learning to Predict default (given excel file containing loan info such as: credit score, loan term, loan amount, payment amount, paymount frequency)
3. Calling Quandl to import financial data from the NASDAQ (eg: Mark-Mark Price, Market Cap, Volume, etc)
4. Integrating Twilio to send SMS notifcations conditional on user defined specifications (such as when a stock reaches X price) 
5. Using the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) annoucments to Predict movements in the VIX (volatility Index) 
5a. Analysing VIX data using sklearn.linear_model and statsmodels.formula.api
6. Financial Sentiment Analysis using BeautifulSoup, nltk.corpus (determine if article is positive or negative)
7. Webscraping using Scrapy Spider API (application: Scrape Financial information from Yahoo finance and output onto xlsx file)
8. Created basic front end UI using TKinter complete with buttons! 

I am new to Github so I will be uploading files on a rolling basis. Hope to connect with you all!
